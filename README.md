# `rpnc`

`rpnc` is a calculator for the command-line which uses
[reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation),
also known as postfix notation, where operators come after the operands like
`45 33 +`.

The calculator is stack oriented, so every value is pushed onto a stack. You can
then use functions and operators against the values on the stack.
